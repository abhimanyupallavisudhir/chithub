Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what counts as \"money\" by thinking about liquidity and general acceptability as a medium of exchange:\n\n1. Base money (most \"money-like\")\n- Physical cash\n- Bank reserves at the Fed\nThese are directly created by the Fed and are the most liquid form of money.\n\n2. Near-money\n- Bank deposits (checking/savings accounts)\n- Money market funds\nThese are very liquid and generally treated as equivalent to base money in daily transactions.\n\n3. Less liquid financial assets (less \"money-like\")\n- Government bonds\n- Stocks\n- \"Future plots on Mars\"\nThese aren't typically used as medium of exchange but can be converted to money (with varying degrees of ease/cost).\n\nThe key difference between \"money printing\" and \"borrowing\":\n- When the government prints money (via Fed operations), it creates base money directly\n- When it borrows, it creates bonds which are less liquid/money-like\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting - the line between these can blur:\n- If the Fed buys government bonds (quantitative easing), borrowing effectively becomes money printing\n- If bonds are very short-term and liquid, they become more \"money-like\"\n- If everyone believed SpaceX's \"Mars plots\" were guaranteed to be valuable and easily tradeable, they could theoretically function as money\n\nThe key insight from your SpaceX example is that the inflationary effect comes from creating claims on current resources (whether through stocks, bonds, or new money) before the corresponding production exists. The difference with government is mainly about credibility and enforcement power - it can compel future payment through taxation, while SpaceX has to convince people voluntarily.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects?

The key difference is how the creation of new money/stocks affects total spending power.\n\nWhen the Fed creates new base money, it's adding purchasing power to the system without requiring anyone to give up purchasing power elsewhere. Like if I print $100, there's just... more money bidding for the same goods.\n\nBut when SpaceX creates new stock, that stock can only be bought with existing money. So if someone spends $100 on SpaceX stock, they have $100 less to spend on other things. The person who sold them the stock now has $100 more, but it's just a transfer - no new net purchasing power was created.\n\n(This is true even if stocks become very liquid/money-like and people start using them directly to buy things. The key is whether new units can be created without requiring someone else to give up purchasing power.)\n\nNow, there is a way stock issuance can be inflationary - if banks create new loans to buy the stocks. That creates new money. This is one reason why margin lending and financial speculation can sometimes drive inflation.\n\nThis distinction between \"new money creation\" vs \"transfer of existing money\" is really what separates monetary policy from other kinds of financial activity.

The same initial $100 is now being used twice - once by SpaceX and once by me using the stock as money. This is very similar to how bank deposits work - when a bank creates a loan, both the borrower can spend the new deposit and the person they pay can spend it too.\n\nThis is sometimes called \"velocity of money\" or \"money multiplier\" in traditional economics, but your way of thinking about it is more direct - it's just about whether we've created new claims on current goods and services.\n\nThis helps explain why financial innovation and \"shadow banking\" can have monetary effects even without official \"money printing\".

Short term: Only SpaceX's $100 is competing for goods, since your stock takes time to sell\n2. Medium term: As the stock becomes more liquid/traded, your claim starts competing too\n3.

Who buys them:\n- Bonds are often bought by banks and can be used as collateral for creating new money/loans\n- Stocks are less integrated into the banking system\nThis makes bonds more directly connected to money creation\n\n4.

When a store in the US sets prices in USD, they tend to keep those prices unless there's pressure specifically from people with USD trying to buy things. Even if someone could easily convert rupees to USD, the mere existence of more rupees doesn't force US stores to change their dollar prices.\n\nSo while SpaceX stock could theoretically be converted to dollars to buy things, this only affects prices if people actually do that conversion at a large scale. If everyone holds the stock as an investment instead, it doesn't compete for current goods and services.\n\nThis is why central banks can maintain independent monetary policy even in a world of convertible currencies and global stock markets - what matters for prices is not just \"claims that could theoretically be converted to local currency\" but actual pressure from people trying to spend in that currency.\n\nDoes this help reconcile the apparent contradiction?

But there's actually a deep circularity here:\n\nThe equation MV = PY is really just defining V as \"whatever number makes the equation true\" for whatever M you choose to use. So if you use M1, you'll get a different V than if you use M2.\n\nYou could even include stock market wealth or other liquid assets in your M - you'd just get a much lower V since these forms of \"money\" circulate less frequently.\n\nThis actually reveals something profound: There isn't really a clear dividing line between \"money\" and \"other assets\". Instead, there's a spectrum of assets with different velocities:\n- Cash/checking: Very high V\n- Savings accounts: Medium V \n- Stocks/bonds: Lower V\n- Real estate: Very low V\n\nThis is why modern central banks tend to look at many different monetary aggregates and financial conditions rather than focusing on any single measure of the \"money supply\".\n\nDoes this help explain why the choice of which M to use isn't as straightforward as it might seem?"}, "children": {"branch_4": "eca21e9a", "branch_5": "60cab616"}, "parent_id": "07fb8fd6", "home_branch": "branch_4", "tool_calls": null}, "eca21e9a": {"id": "eca21e9a", "message": {"role": "user", "content": "That makes so much sense, thank you.\n\nSimilar to our \"dollars as a unit of US production\" I guess we can think of e.g. various cryptocurrencies as a unit of their respective economies?

If the US prints more dollars, China has to print more yuan to maintain the peg (by buying those new dollars).

This means China's domestic prices (P) become partially driven by US monetary policy, rather than just matching Chinese production (Y)\n\nThis can create tensions if the two economies are in different states:\n- If China is growing faster than the US, maintaining the peg means they can't reduce their money supply to prevent inflation\n- If China is in recession while the US is growing, they're forced to maintain tighter money than they might want\n\nThis helps explain why pegs often break during crises - if the fundamental productive capacity (Y) of the two economies diverges too much, the peg becomes unsustainable without severe economic distortions.\n\nIt also explains why countries that peg often impose capital controls - they're trying to reduce the \"velocity\" of cross-border money flows to maintain more independent monetary policy despite the peg.\n\nDoes this help explain why pegging, while seemingly simple (\"just maintain this exchange rate\"), has such complex economic implications?"}, "children": {"branch_5": "4f5b33ec", "branch_7": "aea86aaf"}, "parent_id": "3a3a2bec", "home_branch": "branch_5", "tool_calls": null}, "4f5b33ec": {"id": "4f5b33ec", "message": {"role": "user", "content": "BTW if you exchange SpaceX stock for dollars and then make a purchase, does that affect the velocity of dollars too?"}, "children": {"branch_5": "bcfa969d"}, "parent_id": "cc50c2ba", "home_branch": "branch_5", "tool_calls": null}, "bcfa969d": {"id": "bcfa969d", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": " Interesting!

V and Y haven't changed, and the equation still holds - just at a different price level.\n\nThis is part of why expectations and confidence are so important in monetary economics. The value of money is, in some sense, a collective belief or coordination point.
